There are level specific custom levels made by Talkhaus members.

Most of these codes targeted to work at the "A Second Mario Bros. Thing,
Episode 1: Analog Funk" game, with an except for "KilArmoryCode.cpp" targeted
probably for MAGL X2 or something also (absolutely no idea for which thing this
code is).

These codes was originally created as a part of LunaDLL which initially had no
scripting language at all, except for LunaDLL Autocode simple language that
wasn't enough to make the complex logic.
