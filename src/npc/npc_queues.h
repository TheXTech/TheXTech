/*
 * The goal of this file is to maintain certain queues to track which NPCs
 * need to be accessed at which times. Ultimately, the intention is to
 * eliminate all loops over the entire NPC array.
 *
 *
 * All queues except paired write/read vector queues share a common interface:
 *   - C++11 iteration over `NPCRef_t`s
 *   - clear()
 *   - insert(NPCRef_t)
 *   - erase(NPCRef_t)
 *   - size_t size()
 *
 *
 * Each type of queue must be chosen for the optimal use case:
 *
 * - Some queues are write-once/read-once per-frame, like the set of NPCs that
 *   currently have one of the Reset flags disabled. They can be simple
 *   vectors, or pairs of vectors if they are simultaneously read and written.
 *
 * - Other queues are read and written frequently, but persist across frames,
 *   like the set of NPCs that are Active or have TimeLeft > 0.
 *   They should carefully be tuned as sets, well-constructed linked lists,
 *   or indexed sorted vectors, depending on use case.
 *
 * - Some queues need to be sorted, and others don't.
 *
 *
 * When implementing a new queue, it is best to start with the set-backed
 * queue because this one has the simplest implementation. Then if profiling
 * reveals a need, we can change the queue.
