This concept allows users to modify and extend the content for their own purposes like that was done at the desktop version of this game. Unfortunately, Android 11+ doesn\'t give the way to grant individual read permission for the specified directory instead of a single file. To run this game you should grant access to all files for the game because of explained reasons.</string>
