**Describe the issue**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Example Case**

Post a link to the level where the issue occurs:    
*levelname.lvl* from [Episode name](https://link.to.episode/)    
Even better: If you make a dedicated test level and attach it to your GitHub Post (pack it as `.zip` or `.7z` first).

**Recording**

Embed or add a link to a Recording here. If it's an in-game issue, you can use TheXTech's built-in GIF Recorder (Press F11 or F10 on macOS). If it's a crash, use a Screen Capture program such as OBS or vokoscreen.

**Vanilla Recording**

Not required, but if you can run SMBX 1.3 (or [use the research version](https://github.com/Wohlstand/smbx-experiments/releases) that will work better on Linux under Wine because of the improved audio engine), it would be appreciated if you made a recording of whether the bug occurs here as well.

**Additional context**

Add any other context that could be useful for solving the problem here. If your problem is tied to your Operating System, add it at the beginning of the Title ("[Windows] Windows Issue").
