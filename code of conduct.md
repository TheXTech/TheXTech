TheXTech is a preserve project of SMBX 1.3, and powered for **Players**. It's based on the [SMBX64](https://wohlsoft.ru/pgewiki/SMBX64) standard, and it also aims for limited compatibility with the other SMBX branches, as well as Low-end device support, NetPlay support, and TAS/Rewind system support. So, any topics on whose purpose is to make the base TheXTech engine with one of the following situations, will be rejected as **out-of-scope**, even with Lua Script System support:

1. Imitating features of non-SMBX games
2. Featuring major gameplay changes
3. Affecting low-end device support
  - We monitor code size, static and dynamic memory usage, and CPU performance
4. Breaks legacy SMBX64 logic
5. Affects past works
6. Spamming new content ideas
7. Causing the engine slowdown
8. Affecting TAS (Tool-assisted Speedrun) Mechanic, Netplay, or rewinding
9. Mentioning unofficial engine features
10. Create lots of forks
  - For anything platform games to be made from scratch, You should use **Moondust Engine** instead, but currently is in progress.
